    "## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Required Apps via Company Portal\n",
    "All installations must be done through the **Company Portal**:\n",
    "- ‚úÖ **Python 3.13**\n",
    "- ‚úÖ **Visual Studio Code**\n",
    "- ‚úÖ **Python Extension for VS Code** (by Microsoft)\n",
    "- ‚úÖ **Code Runner Extension** (by Jun Han)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once installed, confirm Python is available by opening **Command Prompt** and typing:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "where python\n",

    "## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Launch VS Code and Open a Folder\n",
    "- Open **Visual Studio Code**.\n",
    "- Go to `File > Open Folder` and select your working directory.\n",
    "- This ensures VS Code trusts your workspace and can run scripts properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Confirm Python Extension Is Active\n",
    "- Press `Ctrl+Shift+X` to open the Extensions panel.\n",

    "## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Confirm Code Runner Extension Is Active\n",
    "- In the Extensions panel, verify that **Code Runner** is installed.\n",

    "- Python 3.13 is used by default\n",
    "- Code Runner runs in the terminal (so `input()` works)\n",
    "- Output is refreshed each time\n",
    "- Files are auto-saved before execution\n",
