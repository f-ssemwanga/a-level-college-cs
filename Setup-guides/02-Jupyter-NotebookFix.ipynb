    "# ðŸš€ How to Use Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code (School Devices)\n",
    "\n",
    "If VS Code keeps \"Detecting Kernels\" and won't run Jupyter notebooks, follow these steps to fix it:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "On managed school devices, VS Code can't find Jupyter kernels because they're installed in user directories instead of system directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Solution\n",
    "Start your own local Jupyter server and connect VS Code to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Install Required Packages\n",
    "Open VS Code terminal (`Ctrl+Shift+`` `) and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install jupyter jupyter-server ipykernel\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Start Jupyter Server\n",
    "In the VS Code terminal, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m jupyter_server --no-browser --port=8888\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** Keep this terminal open! Don't close it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see output ending with URLs like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "http://localhost:8888/?token=abc123def456...\n",
    "http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=abc123def456...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Copy the Server URL\n",
    "**Copy the complete URL including the token** (the long string after `token=`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "http://localhost:8888/?token=35a44259de03a03354b39c74bf3de99eea046be0921b3360\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Connect VS Code to Server\n",
    "1. Open your `.ipynb` file in VS Code\n",
    "2. When it asks to \"Select Kernel\" â†’ choose **\"Existing Jupyter Server...\"**\n",
    "3. **Paste the complete URL** (with token) into the field\n",
    "4. Press **Enter**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5: Use Your Notebook\n",
    "- VS Code should now connect successfully\n",
    "- The \"Detecting Kernels\" spinning will stop\n",
    "- You can run cells normally\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## âš¡ Quick Workflow for Daily Use\n",
    "\n",
    "**Every time you want to use Jupyter notebooks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start server:** `python -m jupyter_server --no-browser --port=8888`\n",
    "2. **Copy URL** with token\n",
    "3. **Connect VS Code** to the server using \"Existing Jupyter Server\"\n",
    "4. **Work normally** with your notebooks\n",
    "5. **When finished:** Press `Ctrl+C` in terminal to stop server\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Keep the terminal open** - closing it breaks the connection\n",
    "- **Bookmark the workflow** - you'll do this every session\n",
    "- **Use the same port (8888)** - VS Code may remember the connection\n",
    "- **One server handles multiple notebooks** - no need to restart for each file\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## âœ… This Works Because...\n",
    "- We bypass VS Code's automatic kernel detection\n",
    "- We create our own local Jupyter server with proper permissions\n",
    "- VS Code connects directly to our server instead of searching for kernels"
