# Student Grade Management System

**Name:** [Your Name]  
**Date:** [Today's Date]  
**Task:** Build a grade management system using functions and data structures

---

## My Approach

I have chosen to use: **[Circle one: Dictionaries / Lists / 2D Arrays]**

**Why I chose this approach:**
[Write a brief explanation of your choice]

---

## Challenge 1: Data Structure Setup

**Task:** Create your data structure and add 3 test students

```python
# My data structure design:

```

```python
# Add 3 test students with sample grades:

```

```python
# Test: Print my data structure to check it looks correct
print("My student data:")

```

---

## Challenge 2: Add Student Function

**Task:** Write a function to add new students

```python
def add_student(students, name, student_id):
    """
    Add a new student to the system
    
    Parameters:
    students - my data structure containing all students
    name - the student's full name
    student_id - unique identifier for the student
    
    Returns:
    success (True/False), message (string)
    """
    # Your code here
    
```

```python
# Test my add_student function:

```

---

## Challenge 3: Add Grade Function

**Task:** Write a function to add grades for existing students

```python
def add_grade(students, student_id, subject, grade):
    """
    Add a grade for a specific student
    
    Parameters:
    students - my data structure
    student_id - which student to add grade for
    subject - name of the subject
    grade - numerical grade (0-100)
    
    Returns:
    success (True/False), message (string)
    """
    # Your code here
    
```

```python
# Test my add_grade function:

```

---

## Challenge 4: Calculate Statistics

**Task:** Write functions to calculate averages and letter grades

```python
def calculate_average(student_grades):
    """Calculate average grade for one student"""
    # Your code here
    
```

```python
def get_letter_grade(average):
    """Convert numerical average to letter grade"""
    # Grade boundaries: A*=90+, A=80-89, B=70-79, C=60-69, D=50-59, E=40-49, U=<40
    # Your code here
    
```

```python
# Test my statistics functions:

```

---

## Challenge 5: Student Report Generator

**Task:** Create a function that generates formatted reports

```python
def generate_report(students, student_id):
    """Generate a comprehensive report for one student"""
    # Your code here
    
```

```python
# Test my report generator:

```

---

## Challenge 6: Class Statistics

**Task:** Create a function for class-wide statistics

```python
def class_statistics(students):
    """Calculate and display statistics for all students"""
    # Your code here
    
```

```python
# Test my class statistics:

```

---

## Challenge 7: Full System Test

**Task:** Demonstrate all functions working together

```python
# Comprehensive test of my complete system:

```

## Reflection

**1. Data Structure Choice:**
[Why did you choose your approach? What are the advantages and disadvantages?]

**2. Most Challenging Function:**
[Which function was hardest to implement and why?]

**3. Error Handling:**
[How did you handle invalid inputs and edge cases?]

**4. Potential Improvements:**
[What would you add if you had more time?]

**5. Real-world Application:**
[How could this be extended for actual school use?]

---

## Extension Work (Optional)

**If you finish early, try these challenges:**

```python
# Extension 1: Search function to find students with grades above a threshold

```

```python
# Extension 2: Function to save/load data from a text file

```

```python
# Extension 3: Menu system for user interaction

```
